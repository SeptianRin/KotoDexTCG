# KotoDex TCG

KotoDex TCG is a modern Android application built with 100% Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. It serves as a PokÃ©dex for the PokÃ©mon Trading Card Game, allowing users to browse, search, and manage their card collection. The app also features an engaging gacha-style booster pack opening simulator.

This project demonstrates best practices in modern Android development, including a clean MVVM architecture, dependency injection, reactive UI, comprehensive testing, and a full CI/CD pipeline for automated releases directly to GitHub.

## âœ¨ Features

* **Card Catalog:** An infinitely scrolling grid that displays PokÃ©mon cards from the official PokÃ©mon TCG API.
* **Advanced Search:** A functional, debounced search bar to filter cards by name, type, and `evolvesFrom`.
* **Card Detail Page:** A dedicated screen showing rich card details, including HP, rarity, flavor text, attacks with visual energy costs, and a dynamic background that changes based on the PokÃ©mon's type.
* **Interactive Gacha Simulator:**
  * A dedicated screen for opening booster packs with a weighted rarity system to simulate realistic pack contents.
  * An engaging, animated pack-opening experience.
* **Local Collection:**
  * A "My Collection" screen that displays all cards obtained from the gacha simulator.
  * Uses a local Room database to persist the user's collection.
  * Displays a badge on card items to show the count of duplicates.
* **Advanced UI/UX:**
  * **Zoomable Card View:** An overlay for viewing high-resolution card images with pinch-to-zoom functionality.
  * **UI Polish:** A global theme toggle for light/dark mode and custom info states for empty or error conditions.
* **App Size Optimization:**
  * **ProGuard/R8 Enabled:** The release build is processed with R8 to shrink code and resources, significantly reducing the final APK size.
* **CI/CD Pipeline:**
  * A complete GitHub Actions workflow that automatically runs unit and Robolectric tests on every push to `main`.
  * On a successful push, it builds, signs, and creates a new release with an installable, optimized APK.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack & Architecture

This project follows a modern, feature-oriented MVVM architecture with a Unidirectional Data Flow (UDF) pattern.

* **Tech Stack:**
  * **Language:** 100% [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
  * **UI:** [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)
  * **Asynchronous Programming:** [Kotlin Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) & [Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/flow.html)
  * **Architecture:** MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) with UDF
  * **Dependency Injection:** [Koin](https://insert-koin.io/)
  * **Networking:** [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) & [OkHttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/)
  * **Image Loading:** [Coil](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/)
  * **Local Database:** [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room)
  * **Testing:** JUnit4, MockK, Turbine, and **Robolectric** for fast, reliable framework-level unit tests.
* **Architecture:**
  * **Feature-Based Packaging:** The UI layer is organized by feature (e.g., `cardlist`, `gacha`, `collection`), with each feature containing its own View and ViewModel.
  * **Repository Pattern:** A repository abstracts the data sources (network and local database) from the rest of the app.
  * **Clean & Reusable Components:** Shared UI elements are separated into a `component` package.

## ðŸš€ Upcoming Features & Improvements

* **Deck Builder:** The next major feature will be a full-featured deck builder, allowing users to create, manage, and validate 60-card decks based on official TCG rules.
* **Code Quality with Ktlint:** A static analysis tool will be integrated to enforce the official Kotlin style guide, ensuring code consistency and readability.
* **Wishlist Functionality:** Users will be able to "star" or add cards to a wishlist.

## ðŸ¤– CI/CD

This project uses **GitHub Actions** for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/android-release.yml`.

On every push to the `main` branch, the workflow will:

1.  Set up a Java environment.
2.  Decode the Base64 keystore from GitHub Secrets.
3.  Run all unit and Robolectric tests via `./gradlew test`.
4.  Run all Instrumental Test via [android-emulator-runner](https://github.com/ReactiveCircus/android-emulator-runner).
5.  If the tests pass, build a signed and optimized release APK.
6.  Create a new tag and release on GitHub.
7.  Upload the signed APK as a release asset.

To enable this for your fork, you must configure the four required secrets (`KEYSTORE`, `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `KEY_ALIAS`, `KEY_PASSWORD`) in your repository's settings.
